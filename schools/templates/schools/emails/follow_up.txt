Final reminder: 4 free NumScoil places for {{ school_name }} - offer expires 31 Jan

Dear {{ principal_name }},

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email about offering your school 4 complimentary student places on NumScoil, our AI-powered Leaving Cert Honours Maths tutor.

I understand how busy this time of year is for schools. However, I wanted to reach out one final time as this offer expires on 31 January (just a few days away).

QUICK REMINDER OF WHAT'S INCLUDED:

• 4 free student accounts (valid until June LC exam)
• 1 teacher dashboard account
• Timed exam papers, flashcards, AI grading, and 24/7 AI tutor chat
• No payment, no credit card - only a brief feedback form at the end

TO CLAIM YOUR SCHOOL'S PLACES, simply reply to this email and I'll send you the registration codes immediately.

If you're not interested or this isn't the right fit for {{ school_name }}, no problem at all - just let me know and I won't follow up further.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,

Morgan McKnight
